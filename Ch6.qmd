### Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- explain why the normal distribution is central in statistics,
- state the probability density function of the normal distribution,
- interpret the mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$,
- apply the empirical (68–95–99.7) rule,
- standardize a normal random variable using $z$-scores,
- use the standard normal table to compute probabilities.

The **Gaussian (normal) distribution** is perhaps the most important of all continuous probability distributions in statistics.

Its importance stems largely from the **Central Limit Theorem**, which states that the sum (or average) of a large number of independent random variables will be approximately normally distributed — almost regardless of their individual distributions.  

Any random variable that can be regarded as the sum of many small, independent contributions is therefore likely to follow an approximately normal distribution.

We return to this powerful result in Chapter 11.

## The normal probability density function

A continuous random variable is said to be **normally distributed** with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$ if its probability density function is

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} 
e^{-\left(\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right)},
\quad \text{ or } \quad
f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} 
e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^2}.
$$

The normal distribution is completely determined by two parameters (a.k.a its *sufficient statistics*):

- the **mean** $\mu$  
- the **variance** $\sigma^2$

We write:

$$
X \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2).
$$

### Key properties

- The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean.
- It extends from $-\infty$ to $+\infty$.
- The total area under the curve equals 1.
:::

Although the formula may look intimidating, in practice we rarely manipulate it directly. Instead, we work with diagrams and standard tables.[View the Standard Normal table here.](figs/ch6/normal.pdf){target="_blank"}

Take care to use the correct table. Do not confuse the standard normal table with the cumulative standard normal table.

## The bell-shaped curve

![Heights](figs/ch6/heights.png){#fig-heights fig-align="center" width="70%"}

The **empirical rule** (also called the 68–95–99.7 rule) tells us:

- About **68%** of observations lie within $\pm 1$ standard deviation.
- About **95%** lie within $\pm 2$ standard deviations.
- About **99.7%** lie within $\pm 3$ standard deviations.

This rule is extremely useful for quick approximations.

## The role of mean and variance

The normal distribution forms a *family* of distributions.

- Changing $\mu$ shifts the curve left or right.
- Changing $\sigma$ stretches or compresses the curve.

## Standardization and the standard normal distribution

Many bell-shaped histograms resemble the normal curve when expressed in **standard units**.

Standardization means converting a value into the number of standard deviations it lies above or below the mean.

The standardized value (or **z-score**) is:

$$
z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}.
$$

### The standard normal distribution

When we standardize a normal variable, we obtain the **standard normal distribution**:

$$
Z \sim N(0,1).
$$

It has mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
:::

Let's see how to use the Standard Normal table.

![](figs/ch6/normal-portion.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

Suppose we are looking for the area between the mean and $+1.2$ standard units or $z$ to the right.

1. Locate the $z$ value in the first column.
2. Read the corresponding area from the table, i.e. $38.49%$

It's as easy as that. 

Otherwise, compute

$$
Pr(0 \leq z \leq 1.2) = \int_0^{1.2} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} 
e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dx \approx 0.3849
$$
which is quite intimidating.

You've seen the first two columns. What about the rest? This is when you are looking for at, say, $1.25$ to the right, rather than just $1.2$. You get added precision or decimal points. But the idea is the same.

What makes the standard normal tables very useful is when you are trying to find $z$ given the area under the curve.

Analytically, you may be trying to solve:

$$
Pr(0 \leq z \leq z^*) = 0.45 = \int_0^{z^*} \frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2\pi}} 
e^{-\frac{1}{2}z^2} dx
$$
This is even more intimidating!

But from the table, it is easy to see that $z^*$ is about $1.645$ for this case.

### How to use standard normal distribution

Because it is impractical to have tables for every possible $\mu$ and $\sigma$, we standardize all normal variables to $N(0,1)$.

Once you compute a $z$-score:

1. Locate the $z$ value in the first column.
2. Read the corresponding area from the table.
3. Use symmetry if necessary.
:::

### Example 2

For $z = 1.00$:

Area between the mean and $z=1$ is $0.3413$.

Because the curve is symmetric, this applies in either direction.

Hence, area between "1 to the right" and "1 to the left" is about $68%$ i.e. $0.3413 \times 2$! 

---

### Example 3

For $z = 1.38$:

- Find 1.3 in the first column.
- Move across to 0.08.
- The table value is 0.4162.

This means:

$$
Pr(0 \leq Z \leq 1.38) = 0.4162.
$$

---

## Areas between two z-scores

If neither boundary is the mean:

1. Look up both areas from the mean.
2. Add or subtract as needed.

---

## Important benchmark

Approximately 95% of the area under the normal curve lies between

$$
-1.96 \text{ and } +1.96.
$$

We often approximate this using $\pm 2$ for convenience.

More precision will be required in later chapters.

## Example 4: Heights

Suppose the heights of 6,588 women have:

- mean = 160 cm  
- standard deviation = 5 cm  

Assume heights follow a normal distribution, as shown by @fig-heights.

We standardize:

$$
z = \frac{X - 160}{5}.
$$

Suppose we want the probability that a woman’s height lies between 155 and 170 cm.

In standard units:

$$
155 \text{ cm} \rightarrow z= - 1, \quad
170 \text{ cm} \rightarrow z= +2.
$$

Thus we want

$$
Pr(-1 \leq z \leq +2).
$$

Using the empirical rule:

- 95% of observations lie between $-2$ and $+2$.
- By symmetry, half of that (47.5%) lies between 0 and +2.

Therefore, from the standard normal table

$$
Pr(-1 \leq z \leq +2) \approx 0.475.
$$

From the table, that is $0.3413 + 0.4772$ or $81.85 \%$ of women lie in that height range.

That is $Pr(155 \text{ cm} \leq \text{height} \leq 175 \text{ cm}) \approx 82 \%$. Makes sense?

### Chapter summary

The normal distribution plays a central role in statistics because:

- many natural phenomena are approximately normal,
- sums and averages tend toward normality,
- standardization allows universal probability tables.

The $z$-score is the key tool for translating real-world measurements into probabilities.
