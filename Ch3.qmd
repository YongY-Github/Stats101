Descriptive statistics consist not only of graphical summaries, but also of **numerical methods**.\
Since we introduced the histogram in the previous chapter—the most important graphical summary of data—we now turn to **basic numerical descriptive statistics**.

These include:

-   **Measures of central location**, such as the mean, median, and mode\
-   **Measures of dispersion (or spread)**, such as the range, variance, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation\
-   **Measures of relative standing**, such as percentiles and quartiles

Together, these numerical summaries help us describe data in a concise and informative way.

### Big picture

Numerical summaries allow us to describe large datasets using just a few carefully chosen numbers.
:::

## Measure of central location

The **arithmetic mean** (or simply, the *average*) is the most widely used measure of central location. It is calculated by adding up all observed values and dividing by the number of observations.

$$
\overline{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i
$$ {#eq-mean}

The arithmetic mean, shown formally as @eq-mean, is **unique**. Moreover, it has an important and intuitive property: the sum of the deviations of each observation from the mean is zero.

An interesting way to visualize this property is through a histogram. If the histogram were placed on a balance, it would balance exactly when supported at the arithmetic mean.

![](figs/ch3/mean.png)

The **median**, another measure of central location, is the midpoint of the values in a dataset once the observations are ordered from the smallest to the largest.

The **mode** is a less commonly used measure of central location and refers to the value that occurs most frequently in the data.

An important advantage of the median is that it is **not affected by extremely large or small values**. For this reason, it is often a more reliable measure of central location when such extreme values are present.

The mode, on the other hand, can be interpreted as the *“fashion category”* of the data. In a histogram, it corresponds to the tallest bar or the highest peak.

::: callout-important
### Key idea

The mean, median, and mode summarize the *center* of the data, but they respond differently to extreme values.
:::

For **symmetrical histograms**, such as the Gaussian (normal) distribution, the three measures coincide:

$$
\text{mean} = \text{median} = \text{mode}.
$$

![](figs/ch3/no-skew.png){fig-align="center"}

But not all histograms are symmetric. If a histogram is skewed to the left or to the right, the three measures may differ.

![](figs/ch3/skew.png)

What is important to realize is that **extreme values affect the average most, then the median, and least the mode**. The arithmetic mean is therefore the most sensitive to extremely large or small values.

::: callout-warning
### Common pitfall

Relying only on the mean can be misleading when the data contain extreme values or are highly skewed.
:::

## Measures of dispersion or spread

![](figs/ch3/mean-not-enough.png)

The three histograms above all have the same average (or mean), yet they clearly look different. Describing a distribution using only its mean is therefore not sufficient. We also need to know how **spread out** the data are—that is, the **dispersion** or **variability** of the observations.

There are many measures of dispersion, including the range, the mean absolute deviation, the root mean square (r.m.s.), the standard deviation, the variance, the coefficient of variation, and the interquartile range. We now focus on the most important of these.

### The standard deviation

The **standard deviation**, abbreviated as **SD**, is the most important measure of dispersion used in this book. There are several ways to define and compute it, but the most intuitive approach is based on the idea of the **root mean square (r.m.s.)**.

The starting point is the notion of a **deviation**, which is simply the distance of an observation from the average. Mathematically, the deviation of an observation ($X_i$) from the mean ($\overline{X}$) is

$$
\text{deviation} = X_i - \overline{X}.
$$

The term **root mean square** is a useful reminder of the steps involved—provided one reads it backwards:

1.  **Square** all the entries\
2.  Take the **mean** of the squares\
3.  Take the square **root** of the mean

In equation form, the root mean square of a variable $X$ can be written as

$$
\text{r.m.s. of } X = \sqrt{X^2}.
$$

This, however, is just a *mathematical operation*.

The **standard deviation** is defined more specifically as the root mean square of the **deviations from the mean**, that is,

$$
\text{SD of } X = \text{r.m.s. (deviation from the average)}.
$$

In simple terms, the standard deviation tells us how far, on average, the observations lie from their mean.

### A numerical example

To make this concrete, consider the list of numbers

$$
20,\; 10,\; 15,\; 15.
$$

The average $\overline{X}$ is 15. The deviations from the mean are therefore

$$
5,\; -5,\; 0,\; 0.
$$

Applying the r.m.s. procedure gives the standard deviation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{SD}
&= \sqrt{\frac{5^2 + (-5)^2 + 0^2 + 0^2}{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{25 + 25 + 0 + 0}{4}} \\
&= \sqrt{\frac{50}{4}} = \sqrt{12.5} \approx 3.5.
\end{aligned}
$$

### Try This: Exploring Mean and SD

**Part 1: Shifting and Scaling**

Find the mean and standard deviation (SD) for the following lists:

**(i)** $1, 3, 4, 5, 7$ **(ii)** $6, 8, 9, 10, 12$ **(iii)** $3, 9, 12, 15, 21$

**Question:** What do you notice about how the mean and SD change across these three lists?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Part 2: Symmetry and Signs**

Find the mean and SD for these two lists:

**(i)** $5, -4, 3, -1, 7$ **(ii)** $-5, 4, -3, 1, -7$
:::

-   Adding a constant to a list does not change the standard deviation.
-   Multiplying a list by some constant $k$ multiplies the standard deviation by $k$
-   Changing each sign of elements in a list does not change teh standard deviation

### Population and sample standard deviation

It is important to distinguish between the **population standard deviation** and the **sample standard deviation**, although this distinction becomes more relevant in statistical inference.

When computing the population standard deviation, we divide by $n$, the number of observations:

$$
\text{SD} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X - \overline{X})^2}{n}}
$$ {#eq-SD}

When computing the standard deviation of a **sample**, we divide by $(n - 1)$:

$$
\text{SD}^+ = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (X - \overline{X})^2}{n - 1}}
$$ {#eq-SD-plus}

We use $\text{SD}^+$ to denote the sample standard deviation. It is numerically larger than $\text{SD}$ because we divide by the smaller number $(n - 1)$ rather than $n$.[^ch3-1]

[^ch3-1]: This is for notional purposes only. Although it may seem counterintuitive, this adjustment corrects for the fact that samples tend to underestimate population variability.

### Variance and the coefficient of variation

Another measure of dispersion is the **variance**, which is simply the square of the standard deviation. While the standard deviation is measured in the same units as the data, the variance is measured in squared units, making interpretation less direct.[^ch3-2]

[^ch3-2]: Variances are especially useful in algebraic manipulations. For example, variances can be added, whereas standard deviations cannot.

Comparing variability across variables measured in different units is often difficult. A **relative measure of dispersion**, known as the **coefficient of variation (CV)**, is sometimes used. The CV is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean, expressed as a percentage.

## Measures of relative standing

::: callout-important
### Key idea

Measures of relative standing tell us *where* an observation lies within a distribution, not just its magnitude.
:::

### Percentiles and Quartiles

There are two important and closely related measures of relative standing:

- **Percentiles**
- **Quartiles**

The **$p$th percentile** is the value for which $p\%$ of the observations are less than (or equal to) that value and $(100 - p)\%$ are greater than (or equal to) that value.

For example:

- The **100th percentile** is the maximum value (since 100% of observations are below or equal to it).
- The **50th percentile** is the **median**, the value that splits the data in half.
- The **25th percentile** and **75th percentile** are called the **first quartile ($Q_1$)** and **third quartile ($Q_3$)**, respectively.

---

### Locating a Percentile

Given an ordered dataset of size $n$, the location of the $p$th percentile can be found using:

$$
L_p = (1 + n)\frac{p}{100}
$$

where:

- $n$ = number of observations  
- $p$ = desired percentile  

If $L_p$ is not an integer, interpolate between the surrounding observations.

---

### Example

Consider the ordered dataset:

$$
\{0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 22, 23\}
$$

This represents the number of internet sites visited by 10 students.

Here, $n = 10$.

**First Quartile ($Q_1$)**

To find the 25th percentile:

$$
L_{25} = (10 + 1)\frac{25}{100} = 2.75
$$

This means the 25th percentile lies **0.75 of the way** between the 2nd and 3rd observations.

- 2nd observation = 1  
- 3rd observation = 5  

Interpolate:

$$
Q_1 = 1 + 0.75(5 - 1) = 1 + 3 = 4
$$

**Median ($Q_2$)**

The 50th percentile:

$$
L_{50} = (10 + 1)\frac{50}{100} = 5.5
$$

This lies halfway between the 5th and 6th observations:

- 5th value = 8  
- 6th value = 9  

So,

$$
Q_2 = 8.5
$$

**Third Quartile ($Q_3$)**

The 75th percentile:

$$
L_{75} = (10 + 1)\frac{75}{100} = 8.25
$$

This lies 0.25 of the way between the 8th and 9th observations:

- 8th value = 14  
- 9th value = 22  

So,

$$
Q_3 = 14 + 0.25(22 - 14) = 14 + 2 = 16
$$

### Interquartile Range (IQR)

The **interquartile range** measures the spread of the middle 50% of the data and is defined as

$$
IQR = Q_3 - Q_1.
$$

Using our results:

$$
IQR = 16 - 4 = 12.
$$

This means that the central half of the observations lie within a range of 12 units.

# The Box Plot

A **box plot** is a graphical summary of data based on quartiles.

To construct a box plot, we need five values:

1. Minimum  
2. First quartile ($Q_1$)  
3. Median ($Q_2$)  
4. Third quartile ($Q_3$)  
5. Maximum  

These five numbers form the **five-number summary**.

For our numerical example above, we have:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Data (avoid naming it df, because df() is an R function)
dat <- data.frame(value = c(0, 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 14, 22, 23))

# Modern horizontal box plot
ggplot(dat, aes(x = value, y = factor(1))) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.35, fill = "#4C78A8", alpha = 0.8, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Internet Sites Visited",
    x = "Number of Sites",
    y = NULL
  ) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 14) +
  theme(
    axis.text.y  = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.y = element_blank()
  )


```

### Chapter summary

Numerical summaries allow us to describe key features of a dataset using a small number of carefully chosen statistics.

Measures of **central location** describe where the data are centered, while measures of **dispersion** describe how spread out the observations are. Measures of **relative standing** indicate how individual observations compare with the rest of the data.

Together, these tools form the foundation for understanding data and prepare us for statistical inference in later chapters.
