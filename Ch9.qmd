### Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

-   distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables,
-   explain why $P(X = x) = 0$ for continuous variables,
-   define and interpret a probability density function (p.d.f.),
-   compute probabilities under the uniform distribution,
-   understand the exponential distribution and its key properties,
-   calculate probabilities using the exponential model.

In contrast to a **discrete random variable**, a **continuous random variable** can assume an uncountable number of values.

We cannot list all possible values because there are infinitely many of them.\
Because of this, the probability of any single value is essentially zero:

$$
P(X = x) = 0.
$$

Instead, we compute probabilities over **intervals**, such as

$$
P(x_1 \leq X \leq x_2), \quad x_1 < x_2.
$$

This is why continuous random variables are described using a **probability density function (p.d.f.)**, usually denoted $f(x)$.

For a valid p.d.f. defined over $a \leq x \leq b$, two properties must hold:

1.  $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$
2.  The total area under the curve equals 1:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = 1.
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Uniform Distribution

The **uniform distribution** (also called the rectangular distribution) is the simplest continuous distribution.

Its probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \leq x \leq b.
$$

Outside the interval $[a,b]$, $f(x) = 0$.

Because the density is constant, probabilities are simply areas of rectangles.

To find

$$
P(x_1 \leq X \leq x_2),
$$

compute:

$$
\text{Area} = (x_2 - x_1)\cdot \frac{1}{b-a}.
$$

### Key intuition

Under a uniform distribution, **all values in the interval are equally likely**.
:::

The mean and variance of a uniform random variable are:

$$
E(X) = \frac{a+b}{2},
$$

$$
Var(X) = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}.
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Exponential Distribution

Another important continuous distribution is the **exponential distribution**.

Its probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \ge 0,
$$

where:

-   $e \approx 2.71828$
-   $\lambda > 0$ is the rate parameter.

The exponential distribution is often used to model:

-   time until a job is found,
-   time until equipment fails,
-   waiting time between arrivals,
-   lifetime of light bulbs,
-   and other “time-to-event” phenomena.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Mean and standard deviation

A convenient property of the exponential distribution is:

$$
E(X) = SD(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda},
$$

Thus, the mean and standard deviation are equal.

Smaller values of $\lambda$ flatten the curve and increase the mean.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Cumulative probabilities

Using calculus, we can derive the cumulative distribution function:

$$
P(X > x) = e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

From this, it follows that:

$$
P(X < x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

More generally,

$$
P(x_1 < X < x_2) 
= P(X < x_2) - P(X < x_1)
= e^{-\lambda x_1} - e^{-\lambda x_2}.
$$

### Memoryless property

The exponential distribution has a special feature called the **memoryless property**:

$$
P(X > s+t \mid X > s) = P(X > t).
$$

The future waiting time does not depend on how long you have already waited.

### Chapter summary

Continuous random variables differ from discrete ones because individual points have zero probability.

In this chapter, we introduced:

-   the general properties of probability density functions,
-   the uniform distribution,
-   the exponential distribution and its tractable probability formulas.

These distributions are widely used in economics, reliability analysis, and queueing theory.
