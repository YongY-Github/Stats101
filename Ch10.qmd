# Uniform and Exponential Probability Distributions {#ch10}

::: callout-note
### Learning objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

- distinguish between discrete and continuous random variables,
- explain why $P(X = x) = 0$ for continuous variables,
- define and interpret a probability density function (p.d.f.),
- compute probabilities under the uniform distribution,
- understand the exponential distribution and its key properties,
- calculate probabilities using the exponential model.
:::

In contrast to a **discrete random variable**, a **continuous random variable** can assume an uncountable number of values.

Because there are infinitely many possible values, the probability of any single point is zero:

$$
P(X = x) = 0.
$$

Instead, probabilities are defined over **intervals**, such as

$$
P(x_1 \le X \le x_2), \quad x_1 < x_2.
$$

For this reason, continuous random variables are described by a **probability density function (p.d.f.)**, denoted $f(x)$.

For a function $f(x)$ defined on $a \le x \le b$ to be a valid p.d.f., two conditions must hold:

1. $f(x) \ge 0$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$  
2. The total area under the curve equals 1:

$$
\int_a^b f(x)\,dx = 1.
$$

## The Uniform Distribution

The **uniform distribution** (also called the rectangular distribution) is the simplest continuous model.

Its probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \frac{1}{b-a}, \quad a \le x \le b,
$$

and $f(x) = 0$ outside this interval.

Because the density is constant, probabilities are simply areas of rectangles.

To compute

$$
P(x_1 \le X \le x_2),
$$

we calculate:

$$
P(x_1 \le X \le x_2)
= (x_2 - x_1)\cdot \frac{1}{b-a}.
$$

### Key intuition

Under a uniform distribution, **all values in the interval are equally likely**.
:::

The mean and variance are:

$$
E(X) = \frac{a+b}{2},
$$

$$
Var(X) = \frac{(b-a)^2}{12}.
$$

---

## The Exponential Distribution

Another important continuous model is the **exponential distribution**, often used for waiting-time problems.

Its probability density function is:

$$
f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \quad x \ge 0,
$$

where:

- $\lambda > 0$ is the **rate parameter**,  
- $e \approx 2.71828$.

![](figs/ch9/exponential.png){fig-align="center" width="60%"}

The exponential distribution is commonly used to model:

- time until a job is found,
- time until equipment failure,
- waiting time between arrivals,
- lifetime of components,
- other “time-to-event” phenomena.

### Mean and standard deviation

A particularly convenient property is:

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}, \qquad
SD(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
$$

Thus, for the exponential distribution, the mean and standard deviation are equal.

Smaller values of $\lambda$ imply a flatter curve and a larger expected waiting time.

---

## Cumulative probabilities

From calculus, we obtain the cumulative distribution function:

$$
P(X > x) = e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
P(X < x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

More generally,

$$
P(x_1 < X < x_2)
= P(X < x_2) - P(X < x_1)
= e^{-\lambda x_1} - e^{-\lambda x_2}.
$$

### Memoryless property

The exponential distribution has a special feature called the **memoryless property**:

$$
P(X > s+t \mid X > s) = P(X > t).
$$

The remaining waiting time does not depend on how long you have already waited.
:::

## Worked Example: Exponential Waiting Time

Suppose the waiting time (in hours) until a machine fails follows an exponential distribution with rate

$$
\lambda = 0.5.
$$

This means the average failure rate is 0.5 per hour.

**Step 1: Find the mean waiting time**

For an exponential distribution,

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{\lambda}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
E(X) = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \text{ hours}.
$$

So on average, the machine lasts 2 hours before failing.

**Step 2: Probability the machine lasts more than 3 hours**

We use the survival function:

$$
P(X > x) = e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

Thus,

$$
P(X > 3) = e^{-0.5 \cdot 3}
= e^{-1.5}.
$$

Using a calculator,

$$
e^{-1.5} \approx 0.2231.
$$

So there is about a **22.3%** chance the machine lasts longer than 3 hours.

**Step 3: Probability the machine fails within 1 hour**

We use

$$
P(X < x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}.
$$

Hence,

$$
P(X < 1) = 1 - e^{-0.5 \cdot 1}
= 1 - e^{-0.5}.
$$

Since

$$
e^{-0.5} \approx 0.6065,
$$

we get

$$
P(X < 1) = 1 - 0.6065 = 0.3935.
$$

So there is about a **39.4%** chance the machine fails within 1 hour.

**Step 4: Demonstrating the memoryless property**

Suppose the machine has already survived 2 hours.  
What is the probability it survives **2 more hours**?

Using the memoryless property:

$$
P(X > 4 \mid X > 2) = P(X > 2).
$$

Now compute:

$$
P(X > 2) = e^{-0.5 \cdot 2}
= e^{-1}
\approx 0.3679.
$$

Notice something remarkable:

The probability of surviving 2 more hours **does not depend** on the fact that it already survived 2 hours.

That is the memoryless property in action.

### Chapter summary

Continuous random variables assign probability to intervals rather than individual points.

In this chapter, we introduced:

- the defining properties of probability density functions,
- the uniform distribution, where all values in an interval are equally likely,
- the exponential distribution, a fundamental model for waiting times.

These distributions play important roles in economics, reliability analysis, and queueing theory.

### Big Picture Reflection

In applied economics, probability models are not chosen randomly.

- The **uniform distribution** models situations with equal likelihood within a fixed range.
- The **exponential distribution** models waiting times and rare, memoryless events.

Understanding the economic mechanism helps determine the correct probabilistic model.
